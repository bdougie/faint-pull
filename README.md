Welcome to Probot on Glitch
=========================

This is the Glitch equivalent of running `create-probot-app` to generate a new probot app locally. Updates to your code will instantly deploy and update live.

## Getting Started

To get your own Glitch-hosted Probot up-and-running, follow these steps. If you need more detail, the [Probot Docs](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#configuring-a-github-app) are a great place to go to learn more.

1. Configure a new app on Github
    - Hit the "Show" button on the top left of this page to take us to the app registration process.
    - Click the *Register GitHub App* button.
    - Pick a name. Use the name you see up in the upper-left corner of Glitch if you don't know what to pick. Click *Create GitHubb App*

2. Install the repo into a repository. Just one. Maybe go [make a sandbox repository](https://github.com/new) real quick to have something to play in.

3. Open a new issue in the repo where you installed your app, and watch for your app to reply!

4. Come back here, and you're ready to code!
